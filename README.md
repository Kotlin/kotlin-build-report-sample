## Kotlin Build Report Sample Ktor Endpoint

This is an example of a Kotlin-based HTTP endpoint for experimental Kotlin build reports.

It is provided as supplemental material to [Introducing Kotlin Build Reports](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2022/06/introducing-kotlin-build-reports/) article as
an example of how one can build an HTTP-endpoint for build reports. It is recommended to be used as an educational starting point and is not recommended 
to be used directly for development and monitoring purposes. 

The repository is no longer updated with recent Kotlin and Ktor versions.
